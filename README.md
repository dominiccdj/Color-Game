# Color-Game
This is JS based game in which you need to guess which color from 3 or 6 offered matches the one written in RGB. This project was a part of Web Development Bootcamp by Colt Steele I was taking a part of.

# What I Learned
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript without any libraries
* Element selectors and event listeners in JS
